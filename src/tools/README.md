# MCPX: Reactive Model Context Protocol

This README will document the architecture, usage, and design patterns for MCPX (Reactive MCPs).

## Overview

MCPX is a protocol and framework for building reactive, extensible, and type-safe model context servers and clients. It is inspired by Redux, modern API design, and VS Code extension patterns.

## Key Concepts
- **Tool**: An atomic operation or capability, defined by a name, input schema, and response schema.
- **Server**: A collection of tools and resources, providing context-aware operations.
- **Action**: A tool invocation, consisting of a tool name and payload.
- **Reducer**: The server logic that processes actions and returns responses.
- **Effect**: Asynchronous operations triggered by actions (e.g., AI calls, file I/O).

## Getting Started
